## About me

I am a fifth-year PhD student (2021 - present) of Department of Computer Science and Technology at Soochow University. I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Min Zhang and Juntao Li. Before that, I received the bachelor degree in Computer Science from Soochow University at 2021. I am currently a research intern at Tencent Hunyuan Digital Human, advised by Dr. Zhaopeng Tu.

I am actively seeking industry positions and welcome opportunities to apply my research to real-world challenges. If you are interested in my work or potential collaboration, please feel free to contact me via:
